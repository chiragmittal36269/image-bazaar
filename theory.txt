to access the value of.env file we need to use this FormData
process.env.name_of_key
.env is included in gitignore so that it is not pushed on github for security purpose
because access key is unique for unique developers.
get env value from the upSplash dev site

create .env file and add the key and value pair
example:-
REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = GVY_7uCh-htQ0dpVr5HTcyZ93R-jCBxXtpFR6FOKWoc
